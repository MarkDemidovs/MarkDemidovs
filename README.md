 # 🫧 hello there! 

i'm mark (马克), a 15 year old full stack + c++ developer based in latvia.

i build whatever interests me and propels my skills, but mostly just to explore new tech

my main tech stack is react, typescript, express and postgresql, though, i am continuously expanding my technical reach by the day! i primarily use visual studio codium, penpot (figma) and obsidian for most of my projects

you may reach me via my x/twitter (@markdemidovs)
