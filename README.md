 # 🔮 hello there! 

i'm mark (马克), a 15 year old full stack + c++ developer based in latvia.

i build whatever interests me and propels my skills, but mostly build for expand my own knowledge.

my main tech stack is react, typescript, express and postgresql, though, i am continuously expanding my technical reach by the day! i primarily use visual studio code, figma and obsidian for most of my projects.

i have a bunch of projects created under my belt, most of them being private (due to being built for my personal knowledge!), but rarely I may create a public project.

you may reach me via my e-mail (markdemidovs@proton.me) or x!
